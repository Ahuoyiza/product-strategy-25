# **Product Strategy Framework Guide**

## **Positioning, Market Sizing, Research, & Go-to-Market Pathways**

This guide provides three essential frameworks to help you turn a great idea (like **The Mango Product**) into a specific, defensible, and viable business strategy.

## **1\. Product Positioning: How You Win**

### **Why Strategy Beats Features**

Most new tech projects focus 99% on *what* the technology does. Strategy focuses on the *who* (the customer) and the *why* (the business reason). Strategy is the bridge that turns a prototype into a product people actually pay for.

### **The Core Positioning Question**

The most important question you must answer is:

**Why should your target customer choose you over doing nothing or choosing a competitor?**

If you can't answer this simply, your customers won't understand it, and your marketing will fail.

### **Framework 1: The Ultimate Positioning Statement**

This 6-part formula forces radical clarity and helps you niche down.

*Note: The product "Mango" starts broadly as a product "for mango lovers." Your goal is to apply this framework to define a specific, profitable direction (e.g., Mango as a recipe app, a premium delivery service, a fitness supplement, or even a fashion brand).*

| Component | Purpose | Example: The Mango Product (Path 1: Premium Delivery) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **For** | **Target Customer:** Who is the *specific* person? | **For** luxury home chefs in urban areas, |
| **Who** | **Customer Need/Problem:** What hair-on-fire problem are they facing? | **who are tired of inconsistent taste and finding rotten fruit at the store,** |
| **Is a** | **Category:** What mental box do customers put you in? | **The Mango Product is a premium monthly delivery service** |
| **That** | **Key Benefit:** The ONE thing that matters most. | **that guarantees perfectly ripe, hand-selected mangoes delivered to their door.** |
| **Unlike** | **Competition:** Who is the alternative (including the status quo)? | **Unlike grocery store produce or large online fruit retailers,** |
| **Our Product** | **Key Differentiator:** Why you win. | **it uses proprietary sensing technology to ensure peak sugar content and flavor every time.** |

### **Common Positioning Mistakes to Avoid**

* **Being too broad:** "For everyone" means 'for no one.'  
* **Leading with features instead of benefits:** Focus on the *benefit* ("save time"), not the *feature* ("has a built-in calendar sync").  
* **Ignoring the "do nothing" competitor:** Your biggest rival is often customer inertia (sticking with the status quo).  
* **Claiming you have no competition:** All great ideas have alternatives or substitutes.

### **Worksheet Activity A: Define Your Positioning**

Use your strategic take on **The Mango Product** and complete the formula below.

| Component | Your Product's Answer |
| :---- | :---- |
| **For** |  |
| **Who** |  |
| **Is a** |  |
| **That** |  |
| **Unlike** |  |
| **Our Product** |  |

### **Competitive Mapping (The 2x2 Matrix)**

Competitive Mapping helps you visually find your white space—the market gap where your product can dominate.

1. Define the Axes: Select two crucial value dimensions that truly matter to your target customer (e.g., Price, Speed, Quality, Ease of Use, Customization). These must be independent qualities.

Example: X-Axis: Low Price → High Price. Y-Axis: Low Quality Assurance → High Quality Assurance.

2. Plot the Landscape: Place your product and 3-5 key competitors (including the "do nothing" option) onto the four quadrants created by the axes.

3. Find the White Space: Your strategic goal is to locate a quadrant where your product is the only offering. This unique combination of value is the foundation of your differentiation and allows you to own that corner of the market.

## **2\. Market Sizing & Research: Validating the Opportunity**

You need to prove your market is large enough to matter but small enough to conquer quickly.

### **Framework 2: TAM, SAM, SOM**

Define the scope of your opportunity:

1. **TAM (Total Available Market):** The theoretical maximum revenue if every person who could possibly use your product *bought* it. (Sets the long-term, aspirational ceiling.)  
2. **SAM (Serviceable Available Market):** The realistic portion of TAM you can serve with your *current* business model and geography. (Your mid-term goal.)  
3. **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market):** The portion of SAM you can realistically capture in the **first 1-3 years**. **This is your immediate Go-to-Market target.**

### **Sizing Methodologies**

* **Top-Down:** Starts big (macro data) and narrows down. Good for telling a story to investors.  
* **Bottom-Up (MANDATORY for SOM):** Starts with the individual customer and scales up. This is the most accurate way to define your immediate revenue target.

**Formula:** (Number of Potential Customers in SOM) x (Annual Price per Customer) \= **SOM Revenue**

### **Market Research: How Do You Know?**

Your SOM calculation and Positioning rely on assumptions. You must validate them with data.

| Research Type | What It Answers | Practical Action for a New Product |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Secondary Research** | What does *existing* data say? | Look up industry reports, competitor pricing, and free public statistics. |
| **Primary Research** | What do *my potential users* say? | Conduct 5-10 quick user interviews and run small surveys targeting your **Target User**. |

### **Worksheet Activity B: Sizing and Research Plan**

1. **Bottom-Up SOM Calculation:**  
   * Estimated Number of Target Customers in Year 1:  
   * Your Product's Annual Price (Subscription/One-time):  
   * **Calculated SOM Revenue (Year 1 Target):**  
2. **Research Validation Plan:**  
   * What is the **biggest assumption** you made in Worksheet A (Positioning)?  
   * What is the **cheapest, fastest step** you can take to validate that assumption this weekend?

## **3\. Go-to-Market (GTM) Pathways: How You Reach Them**

A great product fails if nobody hears about it. GTM is your plan for getting your product in front of the SOM you just defined.

### **Framework 3: The Three Classic GTM Models**

You have three fundamental choices for how you acquire customers. Choosing the right one determines your staffing, funding needs, and speed of growth.

| Model | Focus & Primary Activity | Customer Profile | Best for Early Stage Startups |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sales-Led (SLG)** | **Focus:** Direct human interaction and negotiation to close large deals. **Activity:** Hiring Account Executives (AEs) and Sales Development Reps (SDRs). | High-value B2B customers, enterprises, and accounts with complex regulatory needs. | **NO.** Requires significant capital and a long sales cycle (6-18 months). |
| **Marketing-Led (MLG)** | **Focus:** Generating leads through content, advertising, and brand awareness. **Activity:** Investing in SEO, content production (blogs, webinars), and paid ads. | Businesses or consumers who require education before purchase; products with medium complexity and value. | **Maybe.** Requires moderate initial investment and takes time (3-12 months) to scale. |
| **Product-Led (PLG)** | **Focus:** Getting the user to experience value *before* paying (Freemium or free trial). **Activity:** Building self-serve onboarding, viral loops, and excellent in-product upsell flows. | Products that are intuitive, have low friction, and can be used immediately without a salesperson. | **YES.** Fastest path to adoption, feedback, and scaling with minimal initial team size. |

### **The Easiest Win: Focused Launch Strategy**

Focus on the lowest-friction channels for rapid feedback and adoption when you first launch your business:

1. **Identify Your Target's "Watering Hole":** Where does your **specific Target Customer** (from Worksheet A) already hang out online? (e.g., Niche Subreddits, Industry-specific Slack/Discord, Specialized forums).  
2. **Launch Action:** Focus on low-friction, high-impact channels to get early traction:  
   * **Product Hunt/Hacker News:** Use these communities to announce new, innovative products.  
   * **Direct Outreach:** Email 10 people who fit your user profile and ask them to test and provide feedback.  
   * **Targeted Posting:** Share your project and ask for honest, critical feedback in the "Watering Holes" you identified.

### **Worksheet Activity C: Define Your GTM**

1. **Primary GTM Model:** (PLG / MLG / SLG)  
2. **Target Watering Hole:** Where will you find your first 100 users?  
3. **Launch Action:** What is the single, specific action you will take to get your first 5 pieces of feedback?

## **Summary: Your Strategy Checklist**

Before moving to the next phase of your hackathon project, ensure you have clarity on these four points:

* **Clarity:** Have you filled out the **Positioning Statement**?  
* **Opportunity:** Have you defined your 1-year **SOM** using the Bottom-Up approach?  
* **Validation:** Have you outlined a plan to get **real user feedback** this weekend?  
* **Launch:** What is the single, fastest, cheapest **GTM Channel** you will use?
